# Heat-diffusion-through-skin
SkinTempDiffusion1D calculated the transient temperature throughout the skin for a given outer temperature. 

Run SkinTempPlotter to give a plot of the transient response of the skin termerature at different skin depths both with and without bloodflow at an outer temperature of 393.15K.
Run NoDamageBoundaryTemp to plot the graph for the damage done to the skin at different outer temperatures, at both the dermis and epidermis layer. If gamma>1, damage occurs.
